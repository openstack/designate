    OSprofiler support was introduced. To allow its usage, the api-paste.ini
    file needs to be modified to contain osprofiler middleware. Also
    `[profiler]` section needs to be added to the designate.conf file with
    `enabled`, `hmac_keys` and `trace_sqlalchemy` flags defined.
security:
  - OSprofiler support requires passing of trace information
    between various OpenStack services. This information is
    securely signed by one of HMAC keys, defined in designate.conf
    configuration file. To allow cross-project tracing user should use the key,
    that is common among all OpenStack services they want to trace.
