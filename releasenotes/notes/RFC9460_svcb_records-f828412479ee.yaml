    SVCB and HTTPS recordset type have been added. All users should be able to
    use this type from the API and openstack client. This can be disabled
    (like other record types) by setting the `[DEFAULT].supported-record-type`
    config variable in all designate services.
issues:
  - |
    This doesn't support the arbitrary keys "keyNNNNN" format.
other:
  - |
    BIND9 older than 9.21.8 does not use named Service Parameter Keys
    (SvcParamKeys) by default. BIND9 9.21.8 or newer must be used to support
    the SVCB and HTTPS recordset types.
