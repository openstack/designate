upgrade:
  - |
    Complete removal of eventlet from Designate. All services now use
    native Python threading via oslo.service's threading backend.
  - |
    Updated oslo.service dependency to >=4.2.0 with the [threading] extra,
    which is required for the threading backend support.
  - |
    Default thread counts have been adjusted to reduce potential memory
    issues with Python native threads compared to eventlet greenthreads.
