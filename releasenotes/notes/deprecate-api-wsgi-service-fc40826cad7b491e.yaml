deprecations:
  - |
    The ``designate-api`` service and the ``designate.api.service`` module
    are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The WSGIService
    class relies on ``oslo_service.wsgi`` and ``oslo_service.sslutils``,
    which will be removed in oslo.service 2026.2 as part of the eventlet
    removal effort.
upgrade:
  - |
    Operators should migrate to deploying the Designate API using a WSGI
    server such as uwsgi or mod_wsgi. This has been the recommended
    deployment method and is the default in DevStack. The ``designate-api``
    command will continue to work until the planned removal, but operators
    are encouraged to migrate to uwsgi deployment as soon as possible.

    See the DevStack configuration at
    ``devstack/lib/designate`` and ``devstack/files/wsgi/designate-api-wsgi``
    for an example of uwsgi deployment.
