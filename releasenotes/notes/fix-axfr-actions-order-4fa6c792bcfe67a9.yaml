    If primary zone is updated, Designate does two actions simultaneously:
    1) sends NOTIFY to secondary DNS server
    2) updates its backend
    Notification is significantly faster then backend update. So secondary DNS
    server gets previous zone version (SOA).
    Now it's fixed. Designate sends NOTIFY after successful backend update.
