    New cmd `designate-manage service clean`.
    Previously Designate service always stuck in `UP` even we
    stop provide any heartbeat for long while.
    And no method to clean services status.
    For services that run on containers (like in K8s),
    The list of `UP` services statuses just piling up.
    Add new cmd `designate-manage service clean` to delect and
    clean any service that fail to provide heartbeat within
    double heartbeat interval time.
    `CONF.heartbeat_emitter.heartbeat_interval` default to 10 seconds.
