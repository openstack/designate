features:
  - |
    A new module, ``designate.wsgi``, has been added as a place to gather WSGI
    ``application`` objects. This is intended to ease deployment by providing
    a consistent location for these objects. For example, if using uWSGI then
    instead of:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        wsgi-file = /bin/designate-api-wsgi

    You can now use:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        module = designate.wsgi.api:application

    This also simplifies deployment with other WSGI servers that expect module
    paths such as gunicorn.
upgrade:
  - |
    The WSGI script ``designate-api-wsgi`` has been removed. Deployment tooling
    should instead reference the Python module path for the wsgi module in
    Designate, ``designate.wsgi.api:application`` if their chosen WSGI server
    supports this (gunicorn, uWSGI, etc.) or implement a .wsgi script
    themselves if not (mod_wsgi).
